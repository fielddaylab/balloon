- what does main menu look like?
- what "minigames" are we leaving in? which are we taking out?
- menu buttons for free play mode? (display/hide arrows, particles, etc...)
- how do you advance the text bubble? (click the bubble? click anywhere? timed?)
- who's speaking? (current text very apparantly not in "voice" of any characters on balloon- might need to wait for final-ish text?)
- prompts to "hold the fire button" or "cut the rope" don't have assets
- what did we decide we're doing for the sky? just a continuous gradient? are we getting rid of the faint grid to show apparent motion? if so, will need both vertical and horizontal landmarks always visible so you can see where you're moving
- are we using the green arrow assets from the current game as final? (to show force vectors)
- when increasing volume, there is no room for text bubble. how should this be handled?
- what does the "your score: xxxx retry?" screen look like for all the minigames?

- a different balloon asset with the "top flap open" would be great to better express what is going on when the flap button is held
- particles not performant on chromebook. open to other ideas of how to express diferences in particle speed
